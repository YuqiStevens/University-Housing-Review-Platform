## Introduction

Navigating the complexities of university life, especially for international students, highlights the critical importance of finding suitable housing. The challenge of securing a comfortable living space near the university is compounded by a lack of accessible and reliable information. Our initiative aims to address these issues by creating a specialized platform for reviewing apartments and houses around the university, designed with the unique needs of new international students in mind. This vital resource will provide in-depth insights and real-life experiences from peers, significantly easing the housing search process.

## Motivation

Adapting to university life in a new country brings a myriad of challenges, with housing being one of the most pressing. For international students, arranging accommodation from abroad, often sight unseen, can be particularly stressful. For Stevens, in particular, the campus is small, the school housing is inadequate, and students often live in the surrounding Hoboken and Jersey City. New students are unfamiliar with the new country and region and greatly benefit from the advice of experienced students. A platform dedicated to compiling housing reviews specific to the university area can greatly alleviate this stress, offering a means to discover housing through the shared experiences of fellow students. Such a resource not only fosters a sense of community and trust but also empowers students to make well-informed housing choices, thereby enriching their overall university experience and allowing them to concentrate on their academic pursuits without the added burden of housing concerns.
